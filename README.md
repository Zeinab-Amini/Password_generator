In this project I first imported the random library and followed by three lists of letters, numbers and symbols. 
Then it will ask you how many of each of thoses you would want in your password. 
It will choose random letters and add them to the list.
And do the same thing with the other two. 
After that it will shuffle the elemntes in the list. 
It will add two characters and print your very strong password.
